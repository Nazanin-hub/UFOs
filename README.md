# UFOs
Create a Web Page with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

## Overview of Project

Helping a data journalist to analyze UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. I used JavaScript to display the data as a table and manipulate it by adding filters for the event date, city, state, country, and shape. Then, I put everything together in a tidy HTML page.

## Resources

 - Data Source: UFO data
 - Software: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code 1.49.1, BootStrap 4.0.0

## Results

# UFOs
Create a Web Page with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

## Overview of Project

Helping a data journalist to analyze UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. I used JavaScript to display the data as a table and manipulate it by adding filters for the event date, city, state, country, and shape. Then, I put everything together in a tidy HTML page.

## Resources

 - Data Source: UFO data
 - Software: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code 1.49.1, BootStrap 4.0.0

## Results

### Filtering by date

As the below image shows, the user enters the desired date. The webpage will be updated with the desired date after pressing "Enter".

## Summary

### one drawback of this new design

The drawback of this design is that the user can not see the options list in place of the input fields. For example, if the user wants to enter the desired city, he should go through the table to find the desired city.

### Two recommendations for further development

The first recommendation could be using the drop-down lists. So, the user can select the desired criteria from the list instead of going through the table to find them.

The second recommendation could be inserting a filter button at the end of the filter search part to clear all filters.
